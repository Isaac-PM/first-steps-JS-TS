# About

Functional programming tries to create simple and isolated functions.

## Characteristics

- Isolated: non-dependant on global variables.
- Pure functions: the same input always produces the same output.
- Functions with limited side effects.

## Terminology

- Callbaks: functions passed into another.
- First class functions (all in JS): functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function.
- Higher order functions: functions that take or return other functions.
