# ES6

## About

ES6 was the second major revision to JavaScript. It includes many new features that make it easier to write code. ES6 is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

# Usage of the `const` keyword

Is recommended to use `const` for variables that are not going to be reassigned.

In the case of arrays and objects, the contents mantain mutable.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3];
array[0] = 4;
console.log(array); // [4, 2, 3]
```

In order to prevent this, the `Object.freeze()` method can be used.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3];
Object.freeze(array);
array[0] = 4; // This will throw an exception.
console.log(array); // [1, 2, 3]
```

# Anonymous functions (lamdas)

In ES6, anonymous functions can be declared using the `=>` operator. This are typically used one line functions.

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(1, 2)); // 3
```
