# ES6

## About

ES6 was the second major revision to JavaScript. It includes many new features that make it easier to write code. ES6 is also known as ECMAScript 2015.

# Usage of the `const` keyword

Is recommended to use `const` for variables that are not going to be reassigned.

In the case of arrays and objects, the contents mantain mutable.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3];
array[0] = 4;
console.log(array); // [4, 2, 3]
```

In order to prevent this, the `Object.freeze()` method can be used.

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3];
Object.freeze(array);
array[0] = 4; // This will throw an exception.
console.log(array); // [1, 2, 3]
```

# Anonymous functions (lamdas)

In ES6, anonymous functions can be declared using the `=>` operator. This are typically used one line functions.

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(1, 2)); // 3

const power = (n, x = 2) => n ** x; // Default value for x is 2.
console.log(power(2)); // 4
console.log(power(2, 3)); // 8
```

# Rest parameter

The rest parameter is a way to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

```javascript
const sumArray = (...args) => {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        sum += args[i];
    }
    return sum;
};
```

# Spread operator

The spread operator is a way to represent an array as a list of arguments.

```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const maximumA = Math.max(arr1); // NaN, because Math.max expects a list of arguments.

const maximumB = Math.max(...arr1); // 5, because the spread operator expands the array.

let arr2 = arr1; // arr2 is a reference to arr1.
arr2[0] = 6;
console.log(arr1); // [6, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let arr3 = [...arr1]; // arr3 is a copy of arr1.
arr3[0] = 7;
console.log(arr1); // [6, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(arr3); // [7, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

# Destructuring assignment

Destructuring assignment is a way to extract data from objects and arrays, using a syntax that mirrors the construction of the objects and arrays.

## Example on objects

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    address: {
        city: 'New York',
        state: 'NY'
    },
    age: 30
};

const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 30

// Using different variable names.
const { name: firstName, age: years } = person;
// const {currentPropertyName: newVariableName} = object;

// Nested objects.
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
    yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
    today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
    tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

const {today: {low: lowToday, high: highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;

console.log(lowToday); // 64
console.log(highToday); // 77
```
# Example on arrays

```javascript
function removeFirstTwo(list) {
    const [a, b, ...shorterList] = list;
    return shorterList;
}
  
const source = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const sourceWithoutFirstTwo = removeFirstTwo(source);
console.log(sourceWithoutFirstTwo); // [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

# Template literals

Similar to f-strings in Python.

```javascript
const name = 'John';
const age = 30;
const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
// The backticks are used instead of quotes.
```

# Building and returning an object with a function

```javascript
const createDog = (name, owner) => ({ name, owner });
const dog = createDog('Rex', 'John');
``` 

# Functions inside objects

```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    greet() { // ES6 way of defining a function inside an object.
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
    }
};
```
# Classes

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this._name = name; // The underscore is used to indicate that the property is private, but it doesn't really make it private.
        this._age = age;
    }

    // Getters.
    get age() { 
        return this._age;
    }

    get name() {
        return this._name;
    }

    // Setters.
    set age(updatedAge) {
        this._age = value;
    }

    set name(updatedName) {
        this._name = value;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
    }
}

const person = new Person('John', 30); // The new keyword is used to create an instance of the class.
person.greet(); // Hello, my name is John.
```

> UpperCamelCase is used for class names.

# Integration with HTML

JS is largely used to make web pages interactive. JS can be used to change the content of HTML elements, change the style of HTML elements, and to respond to user actions.

## Adding a script to an HTML page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

# Exporting and importing modules

In order to use the same code in multiple files, it is possible to export and import modules.

```javascript
// filename.js
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
const divide = (a, b) => a / b;

export { multiply, divide }; // First export the functions.

// filename2.js
import { multiply, divide } from './filename.js'; // Then import the functions in the file where they are used.
multiply(2, 3); // 6

// Other way of importing.
//filename3.js
import * as math from './filename.js';
math.multiply(2, 3); // 6
```

# Promises

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JS. A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: 

- fulfilled
- rejected
- pending

```javascript
cont makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
    let responseFromServer;
    if(responseFromServer) {
        resolve('We got the data');
    } else {
        reject('Data not received');
    }
});
```

When a promise gets resolved, the `then()` method is executed. When a promise gets rejected, the `catch()` method is executed.

```javascript
makeServerRequest.then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});

makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
});
```
